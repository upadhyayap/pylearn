# The threading module was first introduced in Python 1.5.2 as an enhancement of the low-level thread module.
# The threading module makes working with threads much easier and allows the program to run multiple operations at once.

# Note that the threads in Python work best with I/O operations, such as downloading resources from the Internet or reading files and directories on your computer.
# If you need to do something that will be CPU intensive, then you will want to look at Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing module instead.
# The reason for this is that Python has the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that basically makes all threads run inside of one master thread.
# Because of this, when you run multiple CPU intensive operations with threads, you may find that it actually runs slower.
# So we will be focusing on what threads do best: I/O operations!

# using locks
# Locks are a very simple way to synchronize threads.
# A lock has two states: locked and unlocked.
# When the state is locked, it does not allow any other thread to enter the code section protected by the lock.
# When the state is unlocked, it allows another thread to enter the code section protected by the lock and then locks the state again.
# This is a very simple way to make sure that only one thread is accessing a shared resource at a time.
# The threading module provides a Lock class to deal with the locks.
# The Lock class has two methods: acquire() and release().
# The acquire() method locks the state and the release() method unlocks the state.
# The Lock class also has an __enter__() and __exit__() method that allows you to use the lock with the with statement.
# The __enter__() method calls the acquire() method and the __exit__() method calls the release() method.
# This is a very convenient way to use locks because it will automatically release the lock when the code block is finished.
# Here is an example of how to use a lock using the try and finally statement:
total = 0
