# iterators: An iterator is an object that will allow us to iterate over a container
# _iter_() and _next_() are the two methods that are used to iterate over an object
# it raises StopIteration when there are no more elements to iterate over
# example:
from itertools import permutations
from itertools import product
from itertools import combinations
from itertools import starmap
from itertools import groupby
from itertools import dropwhile
from itertools import takewhile
from itertools import compress
import operator
from itertools import accumulate
from itertools import count
from itertools import islice

# itertools.compress(data, selectors): Returns an iterator that filters elements from the data returning only those that have a
# corresponding element in selectors that evaluates to True
# The compress sub-module is useful for picking the first iterable values according to the second iterable Boolean values.
# This works by making the second iterable a list of Booleans (or ones and zeroes which amounts to the same thing). Hereâ€™s how it works:

# itertools.takewhile(predicate, iterable): Returns an iterator that returns
# elements from the iterable as long as the predicate evaluates to True;
# afterwards, stops and does not return any more elements and so on.
# It is just an opposite of dropwhile().

# starmap: The starmap tool will create an iterator that can compute
# using the function and iterable provided
# The starmap function is similar to map, but instead of constructing
# a tuple from multiple iterators, it splits up the items in a single iterator
# as arguments to the mapping function using the * syntax.
